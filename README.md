# Task 1 â€“ Logo Design | Oasis Infobyte Internship

For this task, I had the opportunity to showcase my visual design skills as part of the Oasis Infobyte internship program.

The logo features a minimalist black-and-white theme with a bold graphic circle enclosing the initials â€” a subtle symbol of eternity and continuity. This element adds visual interest while maintaining a clean and timeless aesthetic.

### ðŸ–‹ Typography:
- **H1**: 190px â€“ *Cambria* for strong, classic impact
- **Subheading**: 14px â€“ *Arimo* for a modern, readable balance

This design helped me explore how simplicity and meaning can work together to create a memorable visual identity.
